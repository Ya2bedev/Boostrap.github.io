									Hi, I'm the person behind this post. I'm a software engineer
									and I'm looking to start my career as a web developer. I was
									always fascinated by the idea of working with cool codes, so
									when I learned to code, I started working on different
									programming languages and frameworks. Nowadays, there are many
									websites like Codecademy that teach you how to code for free.
									The first thing that you will learn is the basics of HTML and
									CSS. This is where the challenge lies because it’s not as easy
									as some people may think! <br />
									— I want to be a web developer. One of the things that I love
									about being a web developer is the flexibility and control
									over your development environment. I started developing
									websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript in my own time. That
									turned into building my first website for a friend one day,
									which I decided to open source on GitHub as I had just learned
									how to use Git. A few months after that I got offered an
									apprenticeship at a company where they would pay me while they
									teach me how to be a web developer something that I never
									thought was possible before because it’s so expensive and most
									bootcamps are fulltime commitments. Not only did they give me
									the opportunity to learn about career possibilities in the
									industry but now I have job security for life. <br />
									— The whole idea of "learning to program" is a pretty broad
									topic. There are many different ways to learn programming and
									many resources that are used to teach people these skills.
									Programming is a language, and like any language, it can be
									learned in a few different ways. Some people may decide that
									the best way for them is to take an online class from a
									reputable school like Coursera or Udacity and learn alongside
									thousands of others at the same time. Others might find it
									easier if they can interact with real humans in real time, so
									they go for an in-person class somewhere close by their house
									or office. Still others might learn best if they have someone
									explain it to them one-on-one - often without even looking at
									the computer at all - so they go for a live coding session
									with someone from their local Meetup group. <br />
									— Programming is a skill that requires dedication and practice
									to master. As I am learning how to program, I have found it
									can be challenging and frustrating at times. It is also a
									topic of concern for many people, who are surprised by my
									decision to learn how to code.
